1. git : Git is a version control system; think of it as a series of snapshots (commits) of your code. You see a      path of these snapshots, in which order they where created. You can make branches to experiment and come back to    snapshots you took.

   GitHub, is a web-page on which you can publish your Git repositories and collaborate with other people.

2. git checkout : Switch branches or restore working tree files

3. git add : Propose changes to INDEX(staging area)

4. git commit : Record changes to the repository/Commit the file to the HEAD(points to the last commit you've         made), but not in remote repository yet

5. git pull : Update local repository to the newest commit to fetch and merge remote changes

6. git push : Update remote refs along with associated objects

7. git clone : Create a working copy of a local repository by running the command

8. git rebase : Forward-port local commits to the updated upstream head

9. git push -f : Update remote refs along with associated objects

10. git init : Create new repository

11. git-submodule : Initialize, update or inspect submodules
    git submodule init : Initialize all submodules for which "git submodule init" has not been called so far before      updating.
